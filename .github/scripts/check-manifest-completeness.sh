# check-manifest-completeness.sh — every template must be discoverable by the plugin
#
# A "template" is any top-level directory containing a registry.json anywhere under it
# (that's what makes it a Gcore-portal-publishable app). This script fails the build if
# such a directory isn't referenced by any fastedge-plugin-source/manifest.json 'sources'
# entry — i.e. a new template was added but nobody wired it into the plugin's catalog.
#
# This is what turns "developer forgot to update the plugin" into a CI failure instead of
# a silent gap. See fastedge-plugin-source/.generation-config.md for what to add when this
# fails.
#
# Usage: check-manifest-completeness.sh [repo-root]
